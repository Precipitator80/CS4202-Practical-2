The coursework specification detailed the implementation and analysis of several branch prediction strategies. These included always taken, two-bit, GShare and profiled predictors. The final implementation additionally includes one-bit, global one-bit and global two-bit predictors. Bit predictors, including the GShare predictor, are tested with a table size range from 32 to 16,384 entries. Tests are done on a range of program traces provided with the specification, both using entire files and smaller portions. In summary, the GShare predictor performed best with a large table size for full trace files and two-bit predictors outperformed one-bit predictors.
