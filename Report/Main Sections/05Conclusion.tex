\section{Conclusion}
% Summarise what you achieved, what you found difficult, and what you would like to do given more time.
The final implementation includes a range of branch predictors, including one-bit, two-bit, global one-bit, global two-bit, two-bit GShare, always taken and profiled predictors. Their performance was analysed, identifying common behaviour and investigating exceptions. It was challenging to verify predictor correctness and fully explain behaviour due to the lack of context on the trace files provided beyond file names. With more time, additional predictors could be implemented and tested, such as local and one-bit GShare predictors. Furthermore, expections to common behaviour could be investigated further with more research into each trace file.
